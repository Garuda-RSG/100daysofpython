# 100 Days of Python
This repository contains daily projects from 100daysofPython course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. I have modified the projects from the course.
There are three types of Python projects:
1. Command Line Interface (CLI)
2. Desktop Apps
3. Web Development

## CLI
1. [Hangman](https://github.com/Garuda-RSG/100daysofpython/tree/master/CLI/Hangman)
2. [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/Garuda-RSG/100daysofpython/tree/master/CLI/Caesar-cipher)
